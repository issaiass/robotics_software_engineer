# Assignments for Module #2 : ROS2 2D Turlesim Simulation
- Create all files in *module_2_assignment* package

### Assignment 1: Custom Nodes and Launch Files
- **Objective**: Develop ability to write custom ROS2 nodes and use launch files for running multiple nodes.
- **Tasks**:
Create a custom ROS2 node that makes the
- Turtlesim follow a unique pattern
    - Move in user input radius of circle
    - Move the turtle in logrithmic spiral
Develop a launch file to run the Turtlesim simulation and the custom node simultaneously.
Document the node and launch file creation process, including code and execution results.
- **Learning Outcome**: Understand the development and execution of custom nodes and the utility of launch files in ROS2.

### Assignment 2: Exploring Turtlesim Services and Parameters
- **Objective**: Concepts of services and parameters in ROS2 using the Turtlesim simulation.
- **Tasks**:
Use existing Turtlesim services (e.g., spawn, clear) to modify the simulation environment.
    - Spawn 5 Turtlebots with 1 single launch file in Diagonal from top to bottom.
    - Drive middle 3 turtles back and forth continuosly
Modify the behavior of the Turtlesims using ROS2 parameters
    - change the speed of the turtles
- **Learning Outcome**: Learn how to interact with ROS2 services and parameters to alter node behavior and simulation environments.
